<P>There is no doubt that New York City is called by many famous names such as the city that never sleeps, or the <b> Big Apple.</b> 
    And other bright names that try to describe its beauty. But the truth is that they does not describe its beauty as seen by the eyes.
    On dark New York City nights, large billboards illuminate the city and make it look as luminous as the morning, especially in 
    Manhattan. Just by passing by and lifting your head up, you can see hundreds of skyscrapers.New York City is the most populous
     city in the United States, which makes it a very important <b>cultural and commercial center</b>cultural and commercial center, to affect global trade directly, 
     whether in culture, entertainment, fashion, commerce.The city is distinguished by its location in a large natural port on the 
     Atlantic coast, which helps it a lot in the economic and commercial aspect.New York City is famous for its many tourist attractions,
     whether internally or externally, such as the famous Statue of Liberty, or beautiful green parks such as the famous Central Park,\
     which we were able to watch in many famous international films.It’s so wonderful to visit and enjoy New York City, whether it’s a 
     stroll in Bryant Park, a visit to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and perhaps a ride using the city’s famous taxi or subway.
