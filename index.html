<h6>New York</h6>
<p>
 There is no doubt that New York City is called by many famous names such as the city that never sleeps,
 or the <b> Big Apple.</b> And other bright names that try to describe its beauty. But the truth is that 
 they does not describe its beauty as seen by the eyes. On dark New York City nights, large billboards 
 illuminate the city and make it look as luminous as the morning, especially in Manhattan. Just by passing
 by and lifting your head up, you can see hundreds of skyscrapers.New York City is the most populous city 
 in the United States, which makes it a very important <b>cultural and commercial center</b>cultural and 
 commercial center, to affect global trade directly, whether in culture, entertainment, fashion, commerce.

    <h1>Bipartite Graph Check</h1>
    <blockquote >
<p>
    n the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint 
    and independent sets {\displaystyle U}U and {\displaystyle V}V such that every edge connects a vertex in {\displaystyle U}U to one in 
    {\displaystyle V}V. Vertex sets {\displaystyle U}U and {\displaystyle V}V are usually called the parts of the graph. Equivalently, a 
    bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd-length cycles.[1][2]
