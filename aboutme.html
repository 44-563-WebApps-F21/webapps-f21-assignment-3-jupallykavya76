        </h6>
        <p>
            While not superhuman, he is nearly as strong as a human being can become. He can lift (press)
            a maximum of 750 pounds with supreme effort. Abilities: An accomplished gymnast and acrobat, 
            T'Challa is also an expert tracker. In addition, he has mastered various African martial arts.
            As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to consume a special heart-shaped herb which, in addition
            to his mystical, shamanistic connection with the Wakandan Panther God Bast, grants him superhumanly 
            acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.
